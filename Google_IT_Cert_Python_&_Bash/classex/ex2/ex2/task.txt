Exercise 2:

You do not have access to the database but you have access to the log file for today's activity. You must do the following:

- Get a list of all the newly registered users and gather the following:
	- first and last name
	- email
	- phone number

Some users have submitted and additional information document that saved in the following path for each user "public/uploads/[username]". In each user folder you will find a document named "additional_info.txt". That document contains other phone numbers, secondary emails and people they think should join the Team.

- Go to each users additional info document and add their secondary emails and phones to the list you are making above:

- Additionally, gather the information from people they are referring and make a separate list to use later.

- For each newly registered user. You will find a welcome sms template and a welcome email template that you can use to send them welcome messages.

- If the SMS fails to send, send them an email with the same message from the sms.

- Finally for each Referral from the registered user's "additional_info.txt", create a template sms template named "referral_template.txt" and craft a message to send in order to invite them to the program.
